		"lesson":{
			"Africa":"The world's longest river, the Nile and the world's largest desert, the Sahara, both are home in Africa. The world's hottest place -- Ethiopia -- is in Africa. Based on research evidence, Africa is the place where Homo sapiens originated and then migrated to all the other continents of the world. More than 50 per cent of the world's gold and 95 per cent of the world's diamonds come from the mineral rich continent of Africa. The major animals in Africa include -- cheetah, African elephant, lion, zebra, Egyptian mongoose, giraffe, addax",
			"Asia":"Asia is the world's largest continent of the seven continents in size and population. Asia houses the highest point on earth, the summit of Mount Everest, which is 29,028 ft. (8,848 m) tall. The Indian ocean country is one of the smallest countries in the world and Asia's smallest country. In Asia more than 2,300 languages are recognised. The most spoken languages are Chinese which has more than 1.39 billion speakers while Hindi-Urdu languages (used in India and Pakistan) are spoken by more than 588 million people and there are many different languages in the Hindi-Urdu language group, more than 1,600 languages exist alone in India",
			"Australia":"Australia is the world's smallest continent and is also known as an 'island continent' as it is surrounded by water on all sides. The official name of Australia is the Commonwealth of Australia. Of all the continents in the world, Australia stands at the top of wool production and import. This is because the sheep population in the world's smallest continent is 14 times that of its human population. Two-thirds of Australia is desert land. Instead of Australia, the name of the region including and surrounding Australia is often called 'Oceania'.",
			"Antarctica":"Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. 75 per cent of the world's ice and 70 per cent of the Earth's fresh water is located in Antarctica. Antarctica sees half a year of light and half a year of complete darkness - summer months of December to February give 24 hours of light, while the winter months of late March to late September are pitch dark the whole day. Antarctica saw the coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was -89 degree Celsius. Because of extreme temperature fluctuations, Antarctica is larger in winters by around 14.2 million square kilometers than in summers due to the ice formation around the periphery. The only permanent settlements in Antarctica are the research bases where scientists from different countries come to do their work.",
			"Europe":"Europe and Asia are parts of the same major landmass -- Europe is separated from Asia by the Ural mountains and the Caspian Sea. Europe is surrounded by water on three sides -- Mediterranean Sea in the south, Atlantic Ocean in the west, and Arctic Ocean in the north. The world's smallest country, the Vatican City, is in Europe. Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark in Europe, together form the Scandinavian countries. Three-fourth of the world's potatoes are grown in Europe.",
			"North America":"North America has five time zones and is the only continent with every type of climate. The largest fresh water lake in the world, Lake Superior is located in North America. The world's third longest river - the Mississippi (about 3778 km) - is located in North America. The world's largest producer of maize and soyabean is North America. When compared with the other continents, North America has the highest average per-person income.",
			"South America":" The world's largest river based on water volume and the second longest, the Amazon is in South America. South America houses the world's highest waterfalls, the Angel Falls. Brazil, the country which is the largest coffee producer in the world, is in South America. The major languages spoken in South America are Portuguese and Spanish. "
